Here are the equations without descriptions used in nuclear fission:

1. Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation:
   
   E = mc²

2. Fission Reaction Equation:
  
   ΔE = Δm * c²

3. Chain Reaction Equations:
   These equations involve a set of differential equations known as neutron transport equations,
    which describe the rate of neutron production, absorption, and fission in a chain reaction.
   
     nA + mB -> pC + qD

     In this formula, A and B represent reactant species, C and D represent product species,
      and n, m, p, and q represent the stoichiometric coefficients.
       The stoichiometric coefficients indicate the number of each species
        involved in the reaction.
         It's important to note that this formula represents a simplified representation
          of a chain reaction. In reality, chain reactions often involve multiple steps
           and intermediate species, and the reaction mechanism can be more complex.
            However, the formula above provides a general framework for understanding
            chain reactions.

4. Cross Section for Fission (σf):
    The cross section for fission is a measure of the probability of a neutron
     inducing fission in a nucleus.
      
      σf = ΣNi * σi
      
      In this formula, ΣNi represents the sum of the number of target nuclei of each isotope
       in the target material, and σi represents the fission cross section for each isotope.
        The fission cross section (σi) represents the probability of a fission reaction occurring
         when a neutron interacts with a particular isotope.
         It is dependent on the isotope, the incident neutron energy, and other factors.
          The total fission cross section (σf) is the sum of the individual fission cross sections
           for all isotopes present in the target material,
            weighted by the number of target nuclei for each isotope.

It's important to note that this formula provides a simplified representation of
 the cross section for fission.
  In reality, the calculation of the fission cross section involves more complex considerations,
   such as the energy dependence and resonances. However,
    the formula above outlines the basic relationship between the fission cross section
     and the target material's isotopic composition.

5. Neutron Diffusion Equation:
    This equation describes the diffusion of neutrons in a medium and is used to model
     their behavior within a nuclear fission system.
      The neutron diffusion equation is a partial differential equation that describes
       the behavior of neutrons in a medium. It can be expressed as:

         ∇²ϕ(r) + Σaϕ(r) = Σsϕ(r) + νΣfϕ(r)

     In this formula, 
        ∇² represents the Laplacian operator
            (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y² + ∂²/∂z²) in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates,
       ϕ(r) represents the neutron flux at position r,
         Σa represents the macroscopic absorption cross section,
         Σs represents the macroscopic scattering cross section,
          ν represents the average number of neutrons released per fission event,
         Σf represents the macroscopic fission cross section.

The neutron diffusion equation describes
 the balance between neutron production and loss in a medium.
  The left-hand side represents the spatial variation of the neutron flux and
   the absorption of neutrons,
    while the right-hand side represents neutron scattering and fission events.

 It's important to note that this is a simplified form of the neutron diffusion equation,
  and there are additional terms and considerations that can be included based on
   the specific problem being solved.
    The equation can also be expanded to include time-dependent behavior if necessary.

6. Prompt Neutron Lifetime Equation:
This equation calculates the average time it takes for a prompt neutron to induce fission and is an important parameter in nuclear reactor dynamics.

7. Neutron Multiplication Factor Equation:
The neutron multiplication factor (k) represents the number of neutrons produced by fission compared to the number of neutrons lost through absorption or leakage. It is calculated using various equations and factors.

8. Decay Equations:
Decay equations are used to describe the decay of radioactive isotopes, including the decay of fission products produced during a nuclear fission reaction.

9. Fission Yield Equations:
These equations describe the distribution of different fission products and their yields based on the initial fission event.

10. Fission Product Decay Heat Equations:
These equations calculate the heat produced by the radioactive decay of fission products and are important for reactor design and safety analysis.

These equations are utilized in the study and analysis of nuclear fission reactions, reactor physics, and nuclear power generation. They provide insights into the behavior of neutrons, energy release, and the dynamics of nuclear fission processes.
