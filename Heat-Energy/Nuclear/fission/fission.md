Here are the equations without descriptions used in nuclear fission:  

1. Einstein's Mass-Energy Equation:  
     
       E = mc²  
  
2. Fission Reaction Equation:  
    
       ΔE = Δm * c²  
  
3. Chain Reaction Equations:  
   These equations involve a set of differential equations known as neutron transport equations,  
    which describe the rate of neutron production, absorption, and fission in a chain reaction.  
   
       nA + mB -> pC + qD  

     In this formula, A and B represent reactant species, C and D represent product species,  
      and n, m, p, and q represent the stoichiometric coefficients.  
       The stoichiometric coefficients indicate the number of each species  
        involved in the reaction.  
         It's important to note that this formula represents a simplified representation  
          of a chain reaction. In reality, chain reactions often involve multiple steps  
           and intermediate species, and the reaction mechanism can be more complex.  
            However, the formula above provides a general framework for understanding  
            chain reactions.  

4. Cross Section for Fission (σf):  
    The cross section for fission is a measure of the probability of a neutron  
      inducing fission in a nucleus:  
    
       σf = ΣNi * σi  
    
      In this formula,  
        ΣNi represents the sum of the number of target nuclei of each isotope in the target material,  
         σi represents the fission cross section for each isotope.   
         The fission cross section (σi) represents the probability of a fission reaction occurring  
         when a neutron interacts with a particular isotope.  
         It is dependent on the isotope, the incident neutron energy, and other factors.  
          The total fission cross section (σf) is the sum of the individual fission cross sections  
           for all isotopes present in the target material,  
            weighted by the number of target nuclei for each isotope.  
  
      It's important to note that this formula provides a simplified representation of  
       the cross section for fission.  
        In reality, the calculation of the fission cross section involves more complex considerations,  
         such as the energy dependence and resonances. However,  
          the formula above outlines the basic relationship between the fission cross section  
           and the target material's isotopic composition.  

5. Neutron Diffusion Equation:  
    This equation describes the diffusion of neutrons in a medium and is used to model  
     their behavior within a nuclear fission system.  
      The neutron diffusion equation is a partial differential equation that describes  
       the behavior of neutrons in a medium. It can be expressed as:  

       ∇²ϕ(r) + Σaϕ(r) = Σsϕ(r) + νΣfϕ(r)  

      In this formula,   
        ∇² represents the Laplacian operator  
            (∂²/∂x² + ∂²/∂y² + ∂²/∂z²) in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.  
       ϕ(r) represents the neutron flux at position r  
         Σa represents the macroscopic absorption cross section.  
         Σs represents the macroscopic scattering cross section.  
          ν represents the average number of neutrons released per fission event.  
         Σf represents the macroscopic fission cross section.  

      The neutron diffusion equation describes  
       the balance between neutron production and loss in a medium.  
        The left-hand side represents the spatial variation of the neutron flux and  
         the absorption of neutrons,  
          while the right-hand side represents neutron scattering and fission events.  
  
      It's important to note that this is a simplified form of the neutron diffusion equation,  
        and there are additional terms and considerations that can be included based on  
         the specific problem being solved.  
          The equation can also be expanded to include time-dependent behavior if necessary.  
  
6. Prompt Neutron Lifetime Equation:  
    This equation calculates the average time it takes for a prompt neutron  
     to induce fission and is an important parameter in nuclear reactor dynamics.  
      The prompt neutron lifetime equation describes the time behavior of prompt neutrons in a nuclear reactor.  
       
      It can be expressed as:  
    
       Λ = β / (λ - α)  
    
     In this formula,  
       Λ represents the prompt neutron lifetime,  
       β represents the effective delayed neutron fraction,  
       λ represents the effective neutron decay constant,  
       α represents the effective neutron generation time.  
      
    The prompt neutron lifetime  
      (Λ) is the average time it takes for a prompt neutron to undergo a fission event and be absorbed.  
           It is determined by the balance between neutron production and loss in the reactor.  
      
    The effective delayed neutron fraction  
      (β) represents the fraction of neutrons that are emitted from fission products  
           after a certain delay time.  
          These delayed neutrons play a crucial role in controlling the reactor's behavior and stability.  
    
    The effective neutron decay constant  
      (λ) represents the rate at which neutrons decay and are lost in the reactor.  
    
    The effective neutron generation time  
      (α) represents the average time it takes for a neutron to be born from a fission event  
           and induce another fission event.  
            It is a measure of the neutron population growth in the reactor.  
    
      It's important to note that this equation provides a simplified representation of  
       the prompt neutron lifetime and does not consider all the intricacies of  
        neutron behavior in a nuclear reactor.  
         In practice,  
          the values of β, λ, and α are obtained from detailed reactor calculations and  
           may vary depending on the specific reactor design and operating conditions.  
    
7. Neutron Multiplication Factor Equation:  
    The neutron multiplication factor (k) represents the number of neutrons produced by fission compared  
     to the number of neutrons lost through absorption or leakage. It is calculated using various equations and factors.  
      The neutron multiplication factor equation, often denoted as k-effective or k-eff,  
       is a fundamental equation in nuclear reactor physics that describes  
        the overall behavior and criticality of a nuclear reactor. It can be expressed as:  
      
       k-eff = (Σf * ν * ϕ) / (Σa * ϕ)  
  
      In this formula,  
       k-eff represents the neutron multiplication factor,  
       Σf represents the macroscopic fission cross section,  
       ν represents the average number of neutrons released per fission event,  
       Σa represents the macroscopic absorption cross section,  
       ϕ represents the neutron flux.  
  
      The neutron multiplication factor is a measure of the number of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed in a reactor.  
       A value of k-eff greater than 1 indicates a supercritical reactor,  
        where the neutron population is growing,  
         while a value of k-eff less than 1 indicates a subcritical reactor,  
          where the neutron population is decreasing.  
           A value of k-eff equal to 1 indicates a critical reactor,  
            where the neutron population is in equilibrium.  
  
      The equation relates the neutron production (Σf * ν * ϕ) to the neutron loss due to absorption (Σa * ϕ).  
       It quantifies the balance between these two processes and determines the criticality state of the reactor.  
  
     It's important to note that this equation provides a simplified representation of the neutron multiplication factor  
      and does not consider additional factors such as neutron leakage, scattering, or reactor geometry.  
       In practice, more comprehensive calculations and simulations are performed to accurately determine  
        the k-eff value for a given reactor configuration.

    Decay equations are used to describe the decay of radioactive isotopes,  
     including the decay of fission products produced during a nuclear fission reaction.

       The general formula for a decay equation can be expressed as:  
  
       N(t) = N₀ * e^(-λt)

         N₀ represents the initial quantity of the radioactive material at t = 0,  
          λ represents the decay constant, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.  
  
     The decay constant (λ) is a characteristic property of a specific radioactive material  
      and is related to the half-life (t½) of the material through the equation:  
   
       λ = ln(2) / t½

     The half-life represents the time it takes for half of the radioactive material to decay.  
      By substituting the value of λ into the decay equation,  
       you can calculate the quantity of the radioactive material at any given time (N(t)).  
  
    It's important to note that the decay equation assumes exponential decay and does not consider factors
     such as radioactive decay chains, radioactive daughters, or interactions with the environment.  
      These factors can introduce additional complexity into the decay process.  
  
9. Fission Yield Equations:

      In this formula,  
       Y_i represents the yield of a specific fission product isotope i,  
   Y_total represents the total fission yield,  
       β_i represents the branching ratio or fraction of the total yield that corresponds to isotope i.  
  
    The total fission yield (Y_total) represents the sum of the yields of all fission product isotopes produced in the fission process.  
     It accounts for the entire distribution of fission products.  
  
    The branching ratio or fraction (β_i) represents the portion of the total fission yield attributed to a specific isotope i.  
     It is a relative measure of the abundance of that isotope among the fission products.  
  
    It's important to note that fission yield equations are specific to each isotope and can vary depending on
     the fission reaction and the fissile material involved.  
      Different nuclear data libraries and experimental measurements are used to determine the fission yield values and  
       branching ratios for specific isotopes.

        the radioactive decay of fission products in a nuclear reactor.  
         The equations are typically represented as a sum of contributions from individual fission product isotopes.  
          The general formula for the fission product decay heat equation can be expressed as:  
  
        Q(t) = ∑ (A_i * λ_i * E_i * e^(-λ_i * t))
  
       In this formula,
         Q(t) represents the decay heat at time t,  
         A_i represents the initial activity (number of radioactive decays per unit time) of fission product isotope i,  
         λ_i represents the decay constant of isotope i,  
         E_i represents the average energy released per decay of isotope i,  
         e is the base of the natural logarithm.  
  
      The decay constant (λ_i) represents the rate at which isotope i decays,  
       and it is related to the half-life (t½_i) of the isotope through the equation:  
  
        λ_i = ln(2) / t½_i
  
      The average energy released per decay (E_i) is a characteristic property of each fission product isotope and  
       represents the energy released when the isotope undergoes radioactive decay.  
  
      The decay heat (Q(t)) represents the total heat produced due to the decay of fission products at time t.  
       It is the sum of contributions from all fission product isotopes.  
   
     It's important to note that the specific values for A_i, λ_i,  
      and E_i are obtained from nuclear data libraries and depend on the fission product isotopes present and  
       their respective abundances in the reactor.
