Nuclear Equations merge one sequence of principiles and complex equations of nuclear physic
Here have one of the enumerous equations and human fundamental concepts
Relationed about Nuclear Equations:

1. Equação da Massa-Energia de Einstein:
- The famous equation by Einstein that describe the equivalence between (m)ass and (E)nergy
   in terms of light speed from squared (c²)

    E = mc² 
    
2. Equação de Fissão Nuclear:
- The Equation that connect the energy variation (ΔE) with the mass variation (Δm)
   during the process of nuclear fission, in that c is the light speed.
  
    ΔE = Δm * c² 

3. Seção Transversal de Fissão (σf):
- The transervallis section of fission is one metric of probabillity of one neutron induce
   the fission of one atomic nucleous, She is not one equation,
    but one essential concept of understand the reaction of nuclear fissions nucleares.

4. Equação de Cadeia de Reações de Fissão:
-  The reaction of nuclear fission in one nuclear weapon is one chain reaction,
    in that the neutrons freedomned during the fission induce the fission of other nucleous.
     The equation that describe the tax of production of neutrons in one chain reaction
      is one conjuct of equations differents knowed as equations of neutrons transport.                        


5. Equação de Equilíbrio de Massa:
- The equation is one equilibrium of mass is used to determinate the amount of fissile material
   necessary to sustain one chain reaction,
    this equation take in consideration the tax of fission,
     the tax of neutrons production and the absortation tax about the present materialsA
      in the nuclear weapons  
 
6. Equações Hidrodinâmicas:
- The nuclear weapons, have the use of hydrodynamic equations to modelate and understand
   the implosion and explosion of nuclear material considering the knowledge, expansion,
    iterations of shock waves and other hydrodynamic fenomenous

Certainly! Here are a few more equations and concepts related to nuclear weapons:

7. Equation of nuclear fusion reaction:
    The reaction of nuclear fusion is one process in that two nucleous with small weight
     merge to create one nucleous more weighted, generating one high amount of energy
      the equation describe the energy generated (ΔE) during the nuclear fusion is:
       
       ΔE = Δm * c²
       where Δm is the mass variation during the reaction and c is the light speed.

8. Equation of Energy Yield:
   The quation of energy yield is used to calculate the amount of energy generated
    for one nuclear weapon.
    
    is gived for:
      E_yield = Δm * c²
      where Δm  is the loss of mass during the reaction and c is the light speed.

9. Equation of Flexure Time:
    The flexure time is the necessary time to that the energy in one
     nuclear explosion multiply the value.

     Is calculated using this Equation:
      
      t_double = (ln 2) / (λ)
      
      where λ is the radiocative decaiment constant,
       relationed about the tax of energy generation.

10. Equation Advanced HydroDynamic:
     Including the hydrodynamic basic equations,
      the nuclear weapons include one pack of advanced HydroDynamic Equations
       as the Navier-Srokes equations,
        that describe the movement of fluids in extrem conditions of pression,
         temperature and speed.
